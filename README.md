# Let's make sweet music

This is a little music app project I built so I could try out [Svelte](http://svelte.dev).

### Dependencies

- Node.js (version 22 or greater)

### Installation

```shell
git clone http://github.com/paulbjensen/lets-make-sweet-music
cd lets-make-sweet-music
npm i
```

### Get it running

```shell
npm run dev
```

Then you should be able to open the app on [http://localhost:5173] and see it running there.
